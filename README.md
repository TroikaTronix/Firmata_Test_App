# Firmata Test Program
Updated for macOS Catalina and Later
============



This project allows you to compile the original [Firmata Test app](https://github.com/firmata/firmata_test/) by Jeff Hoefs and Dominik Stadler so that it will run on generate a "hardened runtime" that will run on macOS Catalina and later.

Like the original Firmata Test App, this project relies on wxWidgits, specifically [wxWidgits v3.1.4](https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/).

To successfully compile this project, please arrange the project folders as follows:

    Some_Parent_Folder
    -- Firmata_Test_App
    -- wxWidgets-3.1.4

This repro currently does not allow you to compile the Windows or Linux version. Please refer to the original project for those operating systems.
